      <p>Studieren Ohne Grenzen is a German voluntary student organization which is committed to higher education in conflict areas. We want to make studies for needy young people in conflict areas possible by funding them with scholarships.</p>
      <p>Currently, we support students in Afghanistan, the DR Congo, Sri Lanka and Chechnya. Due to their acquired knowledge, they are able to organize social projects, which contribute to the reconstruction and reconciliation in their home countries. Together with our scholarship holders, we want to make a contribution to the peaceful and sustainable development in countries and regions that suffer from war or its consequences.</p>
      <p>Our target is the financial funding for students, who can’t afford studies by themselves and who are especially motivated to improve their environment. Presently, our organization contains 1200 members in 18 university locations.</p>
      <p>In January 2016, we started a scholarship program with our co-operation partner “auxilio venire e.V.” for East Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, our scholarship holders are supervised by our second co-operation partner “Action Forum for Social Development”.</p>
      <p>Two students are currently profiting from our scholarship.</p><br>
